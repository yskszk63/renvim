[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/yskszk63/renvim)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/yskszk63/renvim)

Outside Neovim aware Neovim launcher.

Open the file in the outer Neovim instance.

## Demo

## Why

I made it because I don't like the nested Neovim to start in Neovim's Terminal.

Launch nvim and pass args If outside Neovim Terminal.

```bash
$ renvim file.txt
```

as Git commit message editor.

```bash
export EDITOR=renvim
alias nvim=$EDITOR
# or alias vi=$EDITOR
